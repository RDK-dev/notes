## Notes

* There are people who have a job genuinely believes that their profession and position is doomed and might as well be replaced or removed altogether. (Must be sad to have a job like that. It's one thing when you don't feel like going to work, but another when you don't see the value of your own work.)
* Another type of bullshit job if an employee disappears and no one notice neither the job was not done nor that he is not at work. The author says it is not unusual in the public sector.
* Bullshit jobs vs. shit jobs. The first is usually well paid and has decent working conditions, while the second is underpaid and often has miserable working conditions.
* The author tells a story about a man who cleaned up after the elephant at the circus. No matter how much he showered, he stank and women tried to avoid him. An old friend asked why he does this to himself when there are so many other jobs out there. He answered: "What, and give up the show business?"
* Extravagance waste vs. bullshit service. Example: a haircut for $50 contra a haircut for $150.
* Receptionists are a sign of seriousness to the company. Many of the receptionists do almost nothing, look or feel important.
* It is good to have a product or service that makes people's lives better. But when you have to make them believe that they need that product or service, then you become unsure of the need for such a product or service.
* An example of a duct taper: when an employee monitors email inbox and has to transfer things in Excel manually. This could be automated or proper equipment purchased to digitize the process.
* Moral confusion
* > "Bought the cheapest software which is unstable, many bugs and looks like a screen saver from Windows."
* A story about a person needed to look busy at work, so he downloaded a text-based browser, changed its appearance and pretended to use a Terminal for work. What he mostly made was change wikipedia articles. (Haha, this is a good one!)
* One employee made sure he had projects from both managers. Then he could tell them that he is working on the other project from the other manager.
* > "Lack of purpose in job, kills people and gets them in to depression."
* > "Pay women, not soldiers."

After reading this book, I wonder about people who have employees. How many of them have wondered if their employees feel like they have a bullshit job.

After coming half the book, it becomes less and less interesting. Could shorten this book at least with a few hours. The author uses unnecessary amount of words to describe some aspects and often talks about the same things over and over.
