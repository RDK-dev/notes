The book is a divided into chapters and each chapter is called after the month actions happened. The book starts in February and ends in January.

The author mentions several times about how Amazon kills the small and medium sizes bookshops.

Weren't many unexpected events in the bookstore. Overall, it's a quick read even though the audiobook lasts 8 hours, 23 minutes.

## Notes

* March
	* An elderly couple trying to sell old books that were not applicable for the bookseller to have them in stock.
	* A family of 6 persons (4 children), bought 6 bags of books. Such occasions happened for rarely. This situation reminded the bookshop owner why he entered this world.
* April
	* Customers who find unpriced books and wonder how much it cost, when the bookseller answers £2, they go out of the store without buying ut and commenting that they will get it cheaper on Amazon. The bookseller checks a copy on Amazon for the price. The cheapest book is £22. Now he raises the book price to £12 in the store. (Hah, Already at £2 it seems like almost free for me.)
* May
	* Price matching software
	* Small Profits Quick Returns (SPQR)
* July
	* Thanks to the ability for people to order books themselves from home or anywhere. It killed extra income for bookshops. It was not a lucrative process, but made some extra money.
* September
	* The bookstore has a facebook page. Once, an active member from this group was in the store and asked the bookseller if he recognized her. She said that they talked once on the phone before. (Must be sad for the customer that the bookseller didn't recognize her.)
	* The rating of the bookshop online goes down. The reason for that is, for the most part, slow delivering, which the bookseller can't do anything for. He still gets bad reviews.
* November
	* A cute story about a little boy walking in the shop and says he needs help to find a gift for his mother birthday. He had £4. His mother liked gardening, and the seller found a book for £6, but let him buy it for £4.
