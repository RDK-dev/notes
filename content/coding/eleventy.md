Since I moved [my main blog](https://justtext.net/) to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), I save some snippets which can be useful, but not used enough to be remembered.

## Include translucion of a file

If a file with njk extension stored in _includes folder, use following:

`{% include "nameOfTheFile.njk" %}`

Obviously, can be used with other files. Just replace extension to the right one.
