He also mentions a concept: Processes, Systems, and Standards.

Step 1: Sender (the person who sends the message)
Step 2: Receiver
Step 3: Message (it should be clear and understandable)
Step 4: Feedback (often overlooked; there is no guarantee that the receiver has understood the message)

7 Key Listening Skills:

* Silence
* Reflection: Repeat what has been said to confirm understanding.
* Paraphrasing: Check the accuracy of what the other person said.
* Asking Open Questions
* Listening Attitude: Avoid distractions like looking at your phone; show that you care.
* Concentration: Focus on what is being said.
* Awareness: Pay attention to verbal messages and body language.
