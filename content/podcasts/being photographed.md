On the podcast [Living Blindfully, in episode 283](https://www.livingblindfully.com/episode-283ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-is-instacart-becoming-less-accessible-and-blind-audio-describer-christine-malec/), at 1 hour and 37 minutes into the show, Christine Malec discusses her discomfort with being photographed without permission. A sighted person, after taking a picture, immediately goes to see the picture to evaluate themselves and check if they look good or if it meets their expectations.

> Christine: I do not like it. I want someone to check, ask my permission first. And I really believe it’s because it’s a language I can’t speak. I can’t evaluate my own photo of myself, and I can’t compare it to anyone. And I’m sure you know people who, as soon as someone snaps a photo, they’re like, okay, let me see it. And they want to evaluate, how do I look? Do I look okay? And it’s not that I’m vain, but I feel that it’s a language I can’t understand, so I don’t want to speak in it, if I can use that metaphor.
