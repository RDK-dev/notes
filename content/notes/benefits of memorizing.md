title: "Benefits of Memorizing"

I like where they talk about how memorizing helps you understand more complex topics better and solve more advanced problems.

I mean, that is 100% true.

When I understand one scale, it helps with the next scale.

And then the next scale gets easier, but you still got to put in the work in order to really internalize all those things.
