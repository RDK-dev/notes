Bookworm, motivation is not about how much you want the ting, but how much effort you will put in the thing

So this one's how to motivate yourself.

What I liked here is they call out the fact that motivating yourself isn't just about how much you want something, it's about how much effort you're willing to put in to actually get the thing.

And the way I've thought about it before is like action versus intention, where motivation is this intention side, and then I have to actually move it over to action in order to make something out of it.

Well, they kind of smush those two together here.
