On the podcast Cortex E150 2024 Yearly Themes, CGP Grey talks about the concept of the missing middle.

It is about price range in products. For example, in the furniture industry, previously you could get a chair for a low, middle or high price.

These days, it's the most typical low or high end. The reason for that is, companies will sell many units for a low-effective price or a limited set for a high price. It has to do with unit cost.

This concept also applies to the content consumption. People either watch 30 seconds videos on TikTok or several hours' depth review on YouTube or a long documentary on a topic they have an interest in.

The concept of the missing middle refers to the phenomenon of middle-range products being pushed out of the market over time
