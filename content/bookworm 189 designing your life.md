In the [episode 189 of Bookworm podcast](https://bookworm.fm/189/) Mike and Cory talking about several things I wanted to jot down.

In the Follow-up section of the show, Cory talks about framework three tens from the previous book, Feel Good Productivity by Ali Abdaal.

The three tens Framework is about when you're doing something, asking yourself the question if it will matter in 10 minutes, 10 weeks or 10 years. It seems like a simple framework, but can be useful to implement when you are stuck with an activity and unsure if you should keep doing it or abandon it.

Energy and engagement are important. You can have time to do the thing, set a calendar event for that, but if you lack motivation or think what's the point, you will not do that.

Two types of activities:

* Energy giving
* Energy draining

Reminds me of when I go in rabbit holes with Dataview, AppleScript and other tools. If I achieve what I want, it will give me the energy. Otherwise, it will decrease my energy.

Mike mentioned [[chickens and pigs in project management|Chickens and Pigs]].

> "Balance happens over time."

Overall, after this episode, I liked the energy of the new co-host of Bookworm, Cory Hixson. Seems energetic and motivated to deliver to the podcast. It often happens that when a show gets a new co-host, it can get tricky to establish a good Chemistry between the hosts.
